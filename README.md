This repo contains Implementation of Overlap add method and Waveform Similarity based Overlap add method for Time scale modification, specifically for Audio Signals. Check out the Jupyter Notebook and you can follow along as well!
The methods implemented are based on the paper ["A Review of Time-Scale Modification of Music Signals", Jonathan Driedger, and Meinard MÃ¼ller.](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/6/2/57)

More information on method and implementation is found in the PDF file (Time_scale_modification_method_description.pdf)
